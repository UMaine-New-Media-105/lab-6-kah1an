I created a bone sprite for my dachshund sprite to catch. I was able to get the dachshund sprite to move with some key pressed conditionals. I had a hard time writing the code for the collision. I was not able to get my dachshund sprite to scale when they collide something is wrong with my code even though no errors are showing up, I think I'm missing something. https://editor.p5js.org/105-Kahlan/sketches/9HqREe9e8
